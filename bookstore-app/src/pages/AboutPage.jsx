                    <p>
                        Bookworm Haven was founded in 2024 by a group of avid readers who were tired of algorithmic recommendations that just didn't get it. We wanted to build a platform that felt more like a conversation with a knowledgeable friend at a local bookstore. Starting from a small passion project, we've grown into a community-focused hub for discovering fiction, science, biographies, and more.
